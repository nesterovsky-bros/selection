Selection tool
===========

In a web project we needed to provide a region selection tool.

As result of this requirement we've created a javascript module [selectionTool](https://github.com/nesterovsky-bros/selection/blob/master/js/selection/selectionTool.js), and a angularjs wrappers [selection](https://github.com/nesterovsky-bros/selection/blob/master/js/selection/selection.js), and [clip](https://github.com/nesterovsky-bros/selection/blob/master/js/selection/clip.js)

The samples [test.html](https://rawgit.com/nesterovsky-bros/selection/master/test.html), and [angularjs-test.html](https://rawgit.com/nesterovsky-bros/selection/master/angularjs-test.html).

The module is implemented through SVG manipulation. Selection paths are defined in terms of SVG.
